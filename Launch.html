<p><center><b>Hey Launch! My name is Charlie Sullivan, and here's my small little site to say hello!</p>

<p>I grew up learning to build computers with my father while he attended school, building the foundation for my passion in technology. I've always loved playing video games, which became my portal into software. 
I have a mechanical mind, and was always more interested in the inner workings of what devised and propelled software. This led to my lighter hobby of tearing open configuration files when I was 10 years old, and eventually more complex files as I learned.</p>

<p>My knowledge with software and programming is very much basic, aware of only small aspects I've taught myself through my common sense and community questioning. Although gaming was my gateway into software, it isn't where I hold my passion.
I'm considering the thought of delving into aviation, as its always been another passion of mine, potentially applying my technological aptitude to creating useful tools for pilots and crew someday!</p>

<p>I'm very excited to begin my venture down this road, and even more so to do it with the Launch team. I'm eager to meet you all and get started!</p></b></center>
